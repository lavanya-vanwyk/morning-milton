## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was write a game in the Ink language, while making use of variables to track player states, in order to have a more complex narrative flow.

## Challenges

Getting a hang of the specific syntax for declaration and for setting variables in the Ink language can be tricky at first, but with a JS basis, it's relatively simple to understand the logic structure, especially when coming to conditionals. The biggest challenge I faced was dealing with how Ink's internal logic deals with conditional blocks of text.

When having a text option only be available if a condition is met, you cannot nest more conditional logic within that text. You'd have to modify with a nested option-list or even have the choice divert to a particular knot, or stitch. Nevertheless, it was a small bump in the road that only required a tiny bit of story restructuring!

### This game was a labor of love - I hope you all enjoy!
